## Project Motivation
People always concentrate most of their attention to Apple Store apps analysis. Since we are able to collect data of Google Play Store from Kaggle.com, we are able to look into the data of Google Play Store and to learn the relationships between Rating and other variables. Below I came up with a few questions to be answered before diving into data.
